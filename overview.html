        <p class="over">The hospital has various departments offering healthcare services in specific areas. All clinical departments treat their outdoor patients in the OPD. Indoor patients are treated in wards, generally organised according to specialties. The 100+ year old hospital offers care and cure facilities through its OPD & dispensaries, indoor medical and surgical departments, 24-hour emergency and casualty management facilities, diagnostics and critical care services.

        The hospital also maintains a medical store for procuring and storing medicines, implants and all consumables. The medicines are dispensed to patients through pharmacy counters located in the OPD complex and various dispensaries. For administering inpatients, wards requisition their requirement of medicines to the medical stores.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="over">Hospitality Industry has grown vastly in the last few decades with more private players entering this sector indicating the ever-increasing scope for the diverse hospitality services and the employment of different professionals & personnel. Since the employment prospects are varied and extensive, there is rapid career- growth with abundant money and freedom, in almost every kind of hospitality service.</p>
        <br>

Globally, we need to share best practices for training and retention and make industry-sponsored educational programs more readily available to employees at every organizational level.</p>
